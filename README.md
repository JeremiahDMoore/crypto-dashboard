<p>Simple web app for researching cryptocurrencies. Links to news and other resources for you to DYOR. Marquee at the bottom to gently remind you to be a smart investor. Top stories of the day in the crypto space, cryptocurrency converter using real time prices. Resource links to graphs, charts, event calendar, etc.</p>
